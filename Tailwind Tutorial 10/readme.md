# @apply and @layer directives

Cons of moving a lot of classes into seperate css
1. Dont move a lot of classes into stylesheet using @apply. Only move those classes into css which are used at many places. Dont move those things which are used at only 2-3 places.
2. When we move a lot of classes into separate css file, then we have to follow the traditional approach to go into css and search for the styles instead of directly getting the styles from the html itself.
